# StormScript v0.6.0 "Fig"

## What's new
* StormScript can now read and write to files
* StormScript now has modules, which allow you to run functions from other StormScript files.

## What's Fixed
* else and else if statements were broken
* length didn't work when used in function inside args
* while loops would cause the parser to increase the current line to the point where it was outside of the scope.
