# StormScript v0.8.0 "Honeydew"

## What's New
* Use the `$` symbol followed by a variable name inside of a string literal to concatenate that variable into the string
* Use `stormscript test filename` to run a live interpretation of filename.sts 

## What's Fixed
* Removed snapcraft files
* Variables can be used in the filenames in the `read` and `write` commands
