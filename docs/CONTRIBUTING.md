# Contributing Guidlines

## FORMATTING RULES

For now I am not too concerned about how pretty code is as long as it is functional. That said, it is prefered that you don't make it a nightmare to read. Create a new branch with the name of the feature to add new features, and be sure to check that someone isn't already working on said feature. Create new files to add new commands, with the only exceptions being global commands (such as `lib`, `glob`, and `func`). Also, when you test your new feature use the provided `example.sts` file. This will make it easier to make sure you actually tested thoroughly. 
 
## Behavior

### What you should do

* provide constructive feedback
* write original code
* report issues

### What you should not do

* Insult others' work
* Insult others in general

## tldr

### Formatting:

1. Write functional code
2. create new branches off of the dev branch to add features.
3. Create new files for new non-global namespace commands
4. Test your features using `example.sts`.

### Behavior

* Don't be a jerk
